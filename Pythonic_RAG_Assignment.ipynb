            "The best way to write a loop in Python depends on what you aim to achieve and the specific scenario you're dealing with. Here are a few common types of loops along with best practices:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **For Loop**: This is often the most readable choice when iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string).\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
            "   for item in items:\n",
            "       print(item)\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "   **Best Practice**: Use `for` loops when you have a known sequence to iterate over, as they are cleaner and more Pythonic.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **While Loop**: Use this when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true.\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   count = 0\n",
            "   while count < 5:\n",
            "       print(count)\n",
            "       count += 1\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "   **Best Practice**: Ensure that there's a way to exit the loop to avoid infinite loops. It's good to keep your loop conditions clear and simple.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Using Enumerate**: If you need both the index and the value while looping through a list, use `enumerate()`.\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   items = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
            "   for index, item in enumerate(items):\n",
            "       print(index, item)\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "   **Best Practice**: `enumerate()` gives you a clean way to access both the index and the item, enhancing readability.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **List Comprehensions**: If you're creating a list based on existing lists, using a list comprehension is often more efficient and cleaner.\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "   **Best Practice**: Use list comprehensions for clear and concise list transformations when you do not need complex logic in the loop.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Break and Continue**: Control the flow of your loop with `break` (exit the loop) and `continue` (skip to the next iteration).\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   for x in range(10):\n",

            "           break  # Exit the loop\n",
