# RAG Features Demo App

This application demonstrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) features using Chainlit and OpenAI. It allows users to upload documents, process them using different chunking strategies, and ask questions to get relevant answers.

## Features

- Upload and process text and PDF files
- Choose between character-based and sentence-based text chunking
- Compare cosine similarity vs. euclidean distance for vector search
- Use category filtering to narrow search results
- Interactive UI with real-time response streaming
